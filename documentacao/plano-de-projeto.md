# Plano de Projeto

## 1 - Introdução
This plan covers the content and enablement portions of the EPF 1.0 project. A separate plan covers the tooling component.

## 2 - Organização do Projeto
See also: www.eclipse.org/epf/ 
The work is divided into a number of content areas. Each content area is lead by a committer that is the content lead, working closely with a number of committers and contributors. The content lead is responsible for making sure that bugs and enhancement requests are triaged and assigned, and responsible for updating the project burndown (status) on a weekly basis. 
We also have a content architect (Ricardo Balduino), who is responsible for the overall structure and integration of content from all content areas.

The work is divided into the following content areas:
* Project management: Chris Armstrong (lead), Jochen Krebs, Per Kroll
• Requirements: Chris Sibbald (lead), Paul Bramble, Ana Paula Valente Pereira, Leonardo Medeiros, Kurt Sand, Bruce MacIsaac, Jim Ruehlin, Ricardo Balduino, and others.
* Change management: Chris Sibbald (lead), Kurt Sand, and others.
* Development: Brian Lyons (lead), Scott Ambler, Ricardo Balduino, and others.
* Architecture: Mark Dickson (lead), Jim Ruehlin, Ana Pereira, Chris Doyle, and others.
* Test: Brian Lyons (lead), Nate Oster, Jeff Smith, Dana Spears, and others.
* General: Steve Adolph (lead), 
* Developer outreach: Per Kroll / Naveena Bereny (leads), Ricardo Balduino, Scott Ambler, Kurt Sand, and others.

## 3 - Medições
The OpenUP component team will use OpenUP/Basic, adapted to address the fact that we are doing content development rather than coding. Key artifacts include: Project Plan (Word), Work Item List (Bugzilla + Excel), Iteration Plan (Word), and Status Assessment (Word).

Progress is tracked using two primary measurements using a point system. It is estimated that 1 point represents 2h of work:
* Project backlog: The project backlog shows progress relative to overall work to be done within the project.
* Iteration backlog: The iteration backlog shows progress relative to work intended for the current iteration.

## 4 - Project Milestones and Objectives

This section covers objectives for the entire EPF 1.0 project.
* Governance process in place, including guidelines for how to work with CVS 
* Tutorials available to help people adopt EPF composer 
* Process tools matured and usable to produce a broad set of processes and method content. 
* Basic set of interfaces / APIs defined, stabilized, and delivered. 
* Deliver basic printing capability.
* Mature content. Deliver a mature OpenUP, and beta quality of one or more other processes, whereof one should be another agile process. 
* Generate a high level of interest around EPF v1.0. Press releases, papers, tutorials, workshops, presentations, etc. 
* Identify a broader set of process champions with an interest to contribute to EPF within a specific domain, such as MDA or project management, or a specific vertical such as telecom.
