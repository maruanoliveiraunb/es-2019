How long is a task cycle? Amount of time spent in each activity? Is this changing?
Any unique environmental constraints: mobile, outdoors, in-flight, and so on?
Which system platforms are in use today? Future platforms?
What other applications are in use? Does your application need to integrate with them?
This is where extracts from the Business Model could be included to outline the task and roles involved, and so on.]

## 4 - Resumo do Produto

### 4.1 - Perspectiva do Produto
[This subsection of the Vision document puts the product in perspective to other related products and the user’s environment. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, state it here. If the product is a component of a larger system, then this subsection needs to relate how these systems interact and needs to identify the relevant interfaces between the systems. One easy way to display the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces is with a block diagram.]

### 4.2 - Pressupostos e Dependência
[List each factor that affects the features stated in the Vision document. List assumptions that, if changed, will alter the Vision document. For example, an assumption may state that a specific operating system will be available for the hardware designated for the software product. If the operating system is not available, the Vision document will need to change.]

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Necessidade</th>

    </tr>

### 4.4 - Alternativas e Concorrentes
[Identify alternatives the stakeholder perceives as available. These can include buying a competitor’s product, building a homegrown solution, or simply maintaining the status quo. List any known competitive choices that exist or may become available. Include the major strengths and weaknesses of each competitor as perceived by the stakeholder or end user.]

## 5 - Outros Requisitos do Produto
[At a high level, list applicable standards, hardware, or platform requirements; performance requirements; and environmental requirements.
Define the quality ranges for performance, robustness, fault tolerance, usability, and similar characteristics that are not captured in the Feature Set.
Note any design constraints, external constraints, or other dependencies.
Define any specific documentation requirements, including user manuals, online help, installation, labeling, and packaging requirements.
Define the priority of these other product requirements. Include, if useful, attributes such as stability, benefit, effort, and risk.]
